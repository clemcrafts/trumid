# Trumid Take Home Task

## I. System Assessment Task

Oh boy! This architecture looks complicated: it's never a good sign.
We want it simple. Here is a list of all the issues I found:

## a. Strengths

### 1. The application is leveraging Docker 
The application benefits from Dockerization, facilitating a more manageable and scalable deployment in the future, even though it's 
primarily orchestrated with docker-compose at the moment.

### 2. Multiple containers share the (pre)-processing load
Leveraging multiple containers to distribute the (pre-)processing workload enhances efficiency but also lays 
the groundwork for horizontal auto-scaling, ensuring the platform can adjust to varying data demands.

### 3. The application is leveraging a distributed message bus 
The application is using Kafka which is a very good choice for a real-time weather forecasting platform offering high throughput, fault tolerance and great scalability.

## b. Weaknesses

### 1. Single Point of Failure in Hosting
Utilizing a single virtual machine for running the entire platform introduces a significant risk of downtime, as it serves as a single point of failure (SPOF). Employing docker-compose in a production setting further exacerbates this vulnerability, signaling a critical area for improvement.

### 2. Inefficient Data Reloading Practices
The strategy of reloading all data from PostgreSQL into Redis at five-minute intervals is highly inefficient. This process not only imposes unnecessary burdens on processing capabilities and network resources but also fails to address the reality that only a minor portion of the data requires frequent updates.

### 3. Event Processor Vulnerability
The event processor, tasked with managing an excessive number of input streams, emerges as another single point of failure. This overburdening raises concerns about the system's ability to maintain reliable performance under strain.

### 4. Latency Induced by SQL Databases
Incorporating SQL databases within a streaming architecture inherently introduces latency. This design choice can significantly hinder the real-time processing capabilities essential for the platform's effectiveness and responsiveness.

### 5. Complexity from Excessive Service Layers
The architecture's reliance on numerous artificial service layers not only adds unnecessary complexity but also predisposes the system to increased latency. Simplifying these layers could enhance performance and reduce the risk of bottlenecks.

### 6. Overdiversification of Technologies
The platform's strategy of employing a wide array of technologies, while indicative of versatility, suggests a lack of focus that could complicate maintenance and integration. Streamlining the technology stack may improve efficiency and cohesiveness across the system.
